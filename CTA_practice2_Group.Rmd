## Exercise 1

Take a subset of the tweets data by “user_name” These names describe the name of the newspaper source of the Twitter account. Do we see different sentiment dynamics if we look only at different newspaper sources?

```{r cars}
 
```

## Exercise 2

Build your own (minimal) dictionary-based filter technique and plot the result.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
 
```

## Exercise 3

Apply the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary to the news tweets, but break down the analysis by newspaper.

```{r}

```
